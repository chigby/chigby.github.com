Words written upon embarking northward, from Philadelphia to Burlington, Vermont.  How can one remain in touch with a past community while also opening oneself to a newer one?

> So once again I’m faced with the urge to change everything, and I’m
> still scared of it.  But now I feel like that fear is a sign I’m
> doing the right thing.

> There are so many things it greatly pains me to leave behind, but
> these things are part of the bedrock of what makes me who I am, and
> mere distance is not enough to remove them from my life.  I do not
> leave because my connection to these things is weak, but because it
> is strong.  So do not fear that I am disappearing forever out of the
> known world.  This is my next adventure---hope to see you in it.
