> Pyrolites, or fire-imps, are fiesty, playful goblins that delight in steam vents and lava flows in the volcanoes of the northern mountains.  They adore pleasing sensations and aesthetics, and if one ventures into the high peaks of their homes, they are ever-willing to barter for new delights that can withstand their burning touch.  Their young emerge from scalding pools full of verve and life, reveling and flitting about on wings that are half-flame.  From afar, villages watch their trails at night and call them fireflies.  The aged of the clan are calmer, with eyes of deep red and skin of charcoal grey.  Not so nimble as they once were, but they will charm you nonetheless with a tale of smoke and ash and steam and light, and other such beauties from fires long since dead.
