Written during my anger-towards-CSS era.  Things have changed since then.  To be honest, as of 2024 I'm in my love-towards-CSS era and have no real respect for RSS, which seems to be what my old-self would have replaced the web with.

> In my dream society, web design elements like fonts and colors would cease to be mandated by the publisher. Sites would send meta-data that says, for example, “this is an article” and the visitor’s browser would format it according to that person’s reading specifications.
