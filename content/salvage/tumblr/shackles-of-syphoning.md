In 2013, Wizards of the Coast held an online event where people were allowed to design, submit, and vote on ideas for a Magic card.  Herein, I ruminated on what that might look like.  Over ten years later, it's cute how quaint this looks.

> I ended up spending [more time than I thought I would](https://scryfall.com/card/tsp/43/temporal-isolation) on this. Shackles of Syphoning was the second design I came up with, but I kept going until I had templated a moderner version of [Purgatory](https://scryfall.com/card/mir/275/purgatory), a bizarre mash-up of [Demonic Consultation](https://scryfall.com/card/ice/121/demonic-consultation), [Liarâ€™s Pendulum](https://scryfall.com/card/mrd/196/liars-pendulum), and [Choice of Damnations](https://scryfall.com/card/sok/62/choice-of-damnations), which would have been better off as a sorcery and probably had too much text anyway, [Smokestack](https://scryfall.com/card/usg/309/smokestack)-in-reverse, and a possibly fun, slightly asymmetrical but sort of unexciting Deathtouch [monger](https://scryfall.com/search?q=monger+block%3Amasques&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name) thing.

> There may still be latent potential in those ideas. I might revist them. Yet the more I thought about the Shackles of Syphoning idea, [the more I liked it](https://scryfall.com/card/dka/11/increasing-devotion). From a flavor perspective, I imagine this as enchanted bonds which immobilizes or weakens all of your creatures and ties them together into a dark, mana-woven web that leeches life from your enemies. You are putting them on a magical leash, giving them only enough freedom to defend you, and sapping any excess energy from them to fuel your life-syphoning spell. Seems like something a black mage would do.
