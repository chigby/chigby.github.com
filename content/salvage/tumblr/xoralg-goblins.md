> The aquatic goblins of Xoralg are reclusive, secretive, and capricious as the seas that are their home.  Matrons will sneak into coral reefs on moonless nights to replace the egg of a moray eel with one of their own.  A goblin reared by eels will inherit their slithery, furtive nature, as well as their greed for gold.  Gangs of Xoralgians have been known to ride the bottoms of boats until they are far from land, and then with the aid of sawfish breach the hull to steal treasure.  The empty hulls they leave behind, shattered on the seafloor.  The gold they secret away to deep caches whispered about by jellyfish and lit only by phosphorescent hunters even more foul than they.
