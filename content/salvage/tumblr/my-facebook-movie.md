No truer Facebook movie was ever made.

> INT. ASTROPHYSICS LAB. AFTER MIDNIGHT.

> CAMERON, bumbling student, is procrastinating writing his thesis
by playing Nethack. He is typing furiously. In the same room, the
cool student MAXIMILIAN is relaxing on the couch, wearing
sunglasses and a pretty wicked scarf and tapping absentmindedly
on a Blackberry.
