Ahh, &ldquo;modern social media etiquette,&rdquo; that writhing morass of worms, that tempest on the palm of a fortune-teller&rsquo;s cat, that shower of charged particles released when a cosmic ray strikes the atmosphere, that colloquium of firefighters standing around a week-old cigar butt, that molten crater filled to the brim with lava in the backyard of a hermit, that dream within a dream, that kelp forest of stingrays and barracuda through which we must all swim before entering paradise, that orchestra whose symphonies are composed of ten thousand notes from ten thousand composers&rsquo; wastebaskets, that first party after Babel shattered humanity&rsquo;s tongue and everyone was drunk on horrible red wine, that book in the shape of a twenty-sided die whose facets each contain more text than the complete works of St. Augustine, that land where everything is perfect and also nothing is perfect.
