<p>In 2013, Wizards of the Coast held an online event where people were allowed to design, submit, and vote on ideas for a Magic card.  Herein, I ruminated on what that might look like.  Over ten years later, it’s cute how quaint this looks.</p>

Black enchantment with text: at the beginning of your upkeep, target opponent loses 1 life for each creature you control and you gain that much life.  You can't attack.

<p>I ended up spending <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tsp/43/temporal-isolation">more time than I thought I would</a> on this. Shackles of Syphoning was the second design I came up with, but I kept going until I had templated a moderner version of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mir/275/purgatory">Purgatory</a>, a bizarre mash-up of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ice/121/demonic-consultation">Demonic Consultation</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mrd/196/liars-pendulum">Liar’s Pendulum</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sok/62/choice-of-damnations">Choice of Damnations</a>, which would have been better off as a sorcery and probably had too much text anyway, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/309/smokestack">Smokestack</a>-in-reverse, and a possibly fun, slightly asymmetrical but sort of unexciting Deathtouch <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=monger+block%3Amasques&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name">monger</a> thing.</p>

<p>There may still be latent potential in those ideas. I might revist them. Yet the more I thought about the Shackles of Syphoning idea, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dka/11/increasing-devotion">the more I liked it</a>. From a flavor perspective, I imagine this as enchanted bonds which immobilizes or weakens all of your creatures and ties them together into a dark, mana-woven web that leeches life from your enemies. You are putting them on a magical leash, giving them only enough freedom to defend you, and sapping any excess energy from them to fuel your life-syphoning spell. Seems like something a black mage would do.</p>
