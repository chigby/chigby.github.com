        <p>Greetings, explorer!  I&#8217;m Cameron, an independent
        programmer, web developer, author, and all-around tinkerer.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Hometown</h2>
        <p>People often ask me where I&#8217;m from.  There is no easy
          answer.  It is easiest to say that I had childhood in rural
          North Carolina, a coming-of-age in arid New Mexico, and an
          education in and around Philadelphia.  But, to quote Robert
          Frost, &#8220;At present I am living in Vermont.&#8221;</p>

        <h2>Folkdance</h2>
        <p>Nine years ago, I took a Scottish country dancing class,
        unsure where it would lead me.  I could not have imagined a
        deeper, more delightful rabbit hole to stumble into.  And even
        now, after enough time has passed to encrust with jade the
        most enthusiastic of converts, I still feel it.  Whether it&#8217;s
        the first jingle of bells on May Day morning, or the last
        skirl of pipes on Hogmanay, I still feel it: the giddiness of
        having fallen into wonderland.</p>

        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <!-- chapter 19: "ultra" -->
        <blockquote>&#8220;Turing realized that it should be possible to build a meta-machine that could be reconfigured in such a way that it would do any task you could conceivably do with information. It would be a protean device that could turn into any tool you could ever need. Like a pipe organ changing into a different instrument every time you hit a preset button.&#8221; &#8212; Neal Stephenson, <i>Cryptonomicon</i></blockquote>
        <p>Programming computers was never my dream.  But at every
        stage of my life, there I was, typing away.  I now find myself
        always in their midst, for better or for worse, and my desire
        and need to explore their potential has never been stronger.
        Coding is my attempt to master the most versatile and
        extraordinary tool ever devised.</p>

        <h2>Bookworms</h2>
        <p>Nowadays, a <em>bookworm</em> is someone who reads a lot.
        Kind of a compliment, or an identity badge.  But for the
        Anglo-Saxons, a thousand years before the internet and its
        ubiquitous information stream, the <em>wyrm</em> was the
        literal devourer of knowledge.  Moth larvae chewed up and
        digested tomes and libraries &#8212; the cultural memory.</p>
        <p>Even in the modern age, with its endless archives and
        backups, I find it hard to separate the knowledge and actions
        that will truly change lives and the world, and those that are
        ultimately worm food.  How can I affect people in a deep and
        lasting way?  How can I be a good person?  How can I create
        something that can withstand the maw of edacious time?</p>
        <h2>Astronomy</h2>
        <p>I came to astronomy for the big numbers: the fastest winds
        in the solar system, the size of the Great Red Spot, the
        number of stars in the Milky Way, the pressure at the core of
        a collapsing supergiant, the gravity of a black hole.  But the
        theory is what hooked me.  We can, right now, sitting at a
        desk on a planet orbiting a star adrift in the near-vacuum of
        a galaxy on its path from the beginning of the universe to
        infinity, write down and understand equations that govern the
        past, present, and future of the planet, the star, the vacuum,
        the galaxy, the beginning of the universe and its infinite
        fate.  This is incredible.  The big numbers are only the
        flashy pop-up ad for the true scope of the astronomer's art,
        no less grand than the comprehension of time from beginning to
        end, and of all that occurs therein.</p>
