## Favorite retro/cosmic dark ambient

New-to-me artist Jim Kirkwood has apparently beem making this kind of
music since time immemorial, so I'm pleased to have been finally
introduced to it.  Cosmic, weird, disconcerting: is it dark ambient?
Is it dungeon synth?  Can one enter a strange zone-out realm with
enough repeated exposures, as I have done this year?  Yes.

{{ content.figure(kirkwood, caption="Souls that Dance on The Edge of a Sword", attrs={class: "popout"}) }}

## Favorite new(er) dark ambient

Using "new" here to mean released in the last ten years.  For me, this
album is less about entering a zone-out realm and more about crossing
the threshold of night into a haunting saga---yes, a _saga_---at once
wistful, isolated, dreaming, wakeful, desolate, still.  Also, there is
a significant amount of viola, which one cannot really object to.  I struggle to pick a favorite track, but "March of the Priests" and "Apokatástasis II" both rule.

## Most listened-to ten-second sequence

I don't know what this says about me but I became, for a brief time, obsessed the music in this trailer for _The Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3_, which is a somewhat lugubrious symphonic rendition of ["Since You've Been Gone" by Rainbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1P17ct4e5OE). Specifically, for reasons unknown, I simply had to figure out what the chord progression was for the sequence starting at 1:27, and in particular exactly what the orchestral bass is doing at 1:33, as a guy is thrown into a enormous white sculpture oozing with yellow fluid.

{{ content.figure(guardians, caption="_Since You've Been Gone_ as imagined by Marvel.  The time from 1:27 to 1:35 (or so) proved a hypnotic earworm and quasi-academic pursuit.", attrs={class: "popout"}) }}

## Most listened-to for the purpose of chilling out

Something about these beats just moves slowly, breathes deeply, and wires my brain up for a state of quasi-active (as in, not fully zonked out-of-it) chilled out vibrations.  It's good!  A very common pick when I'm wanting music but I don't know what to listen to.

## Pop history anthologies

Good to get in touch with the roots of the world (or what feels like the world) of the music of one's youth, but at an age where one feels less need to apply enormous amounts of judgment.  The past couple years, actually, feel like they've been eras of being able to reach back into the past and unseal the latent and suppressed enjoyment of pop music.  It feels good, you know?

Also adding this Youtube video which was recommended to me by an algorithm one late night which I did have a hard time turning off once I started it up.

## Year's best re-release of a song using the incredibly powerful I-V-vi-IV chord progression

What more can one say, really?

## Ideal soundtrack for grinding gold in Magic Arena (or anything in any game)

It stands to reason that one of the nerdier instantiations of the "lo-fi beats to chillax/study to" trend would be the one that latched onto me.  Very appropriate to pop one of these on (and there [is a lot more](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFeA52fxqVTIqDsMhgfNTVwxpSlwjlcDT) where [these came from](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY0KbDiiFYeOD_pjiZ3I_RrZzJ2dWAYqj)) and aim oneself at a somewhat pointless yet satisfying goal in some video game and just, let it wash over you.  Quite apropriate that the creators of two games that brought "Grinding" into the mainstream would also create a compelling soundtrack for the general-purpose compulsion to do it.

## Web

> It's the darkest hour, you're 22\
> The voice of youth, the hour of dread\
> The darkest hour, and your voice is new\
> Love is lost, lost is love

This one is new-to-me this year, and it's probably been around for a while, but when have I ever been on the cutting edge of anything?  Sometimes the ephemeral spiderweb that binds us to one another, and to the devouring jaws of time, vibrates on a certain frequency, collects droplets of dew of a certain scent.  This year that scent, that vibration, maybe, was something akin to this song.

> You refuse to talk, but you think like mad\
> You've cut out your soul and the face of thought\
> Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?\
> Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?

## Late-breaking entry from a metal legend who now makes 80s pastiche music

No one told me this came out in the past month.  Maybe no one told you either?  Anyway, here's what's sure to be the track of the moment from the musical mind that brought you [_Nattens Madrigal_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3WdtS4FZck).  I'm into it!  But I also have a soft spot for musical chameleons.
