## Favorite retro/cosmic dark ambient

New-to-me artist Jim Kirkwood has apparently beem making this kind of
music since time immemorial, so I'm pleased to have been finally
introduced to it.  Cosmic, weird, disconcerting: is it dark ambient?
Is it dungeon synth?  Can one enter a strange zone-out realm with
enough repeated exposures, as I have done this year?  Yes.

## Favorite new(er) dark ambient

Using "new" here to mean released in the last ten years.  For me, this
album is less about entering a zone-out realm and more about crossing
the threshold of night into a haunting saga---yes, a _saga_---at once
wistful, isolated, dreaming, wakeful, desolate, still.  Also, there is
a significant amount of viola, which one cannot really object to.  I struggle to pick a favorite track, but "March of the Priests" and "Apokatástasis II" both rule.
